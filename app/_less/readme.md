Grunt handles all compass configuration. You can configure compiler 
settings in the project's Gruntfile.js.

Require libraries or extensions in the Gruntfile or place them in 
'app/_bower_components'.

For detailed information on configuring compass with Grunt, see the docs 
at https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-less.
